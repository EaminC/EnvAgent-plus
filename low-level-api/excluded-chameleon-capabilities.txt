POWER MONITORING (NOT REQUIRED FOR ENVAGENT-PLUS)
https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/power_monitoring/index.html

Chameleon provides multiple power monitoring mechanisms, including IPMI/DCMI 
infrastructure-level readings, application-level tools (perf, etrace2, Scaphandre),
and long-term Prometheus/Grafana exporters. These tools measure node power usage 
and energy consumption during experiments.

EnvAgent-plus does not perform energy-aware experimentation and does not collect 
or analyze system power data. Since the agent is designed for resource discovery,
reservation handling, instance launch, and lifecycle automation—not experiment-level
instrumentation—power monitoring functionality is excluded from this document.


====================================================
COMPLEX APPLIANCES (NOT REQUIRED FOR ENVAGENT-PLUS)
https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/complex/cli_management.html

Chameleon supports launching multi-instance “Complex Appliances” using OpenStack
Heat stacks. These provide orchestration for templates that define clusters,
NFS servers, client groups, or multi-resource deployments.

EnvAgent-plus does not use Heat stacks. The agent operates at the levels of:
- resource discovery (Root → Sites → Clusters → Nodes)
- reservation creation and inspection via Blazar
- bare-metal server launch via Nova
- instance lifecycle management
- image and network selection

Since Heat is not part of the provisioning workflow required by EnvAgent-plus,
Complex Appliances are excluded from this document.


====================================================
OBJECT STORE / SWIFT (NOT REQUIRED FOR ENVAGENT-PLUS)
https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/swift/index.html

Chameleon provides an OpenStack Swift Object Store for uploading, downloading,
and managing data objects and containers (similar to AWS S3). Operations include
creating containers, uploading files, listing objects, downloading objects, and
handling segmented uploads for files larger than 4 GB.

EnvAgent-plus does not upload or manage user datasets, nor does it interact with
Swift containers or objects. The agent’s responsibilities are limited to resource
discovery, reservations, image selection, network selection, and bare-metal/VM
launch workflows. Because object storage is not involved in provisioning or
orchestration, it is excluded from this document.



====================================================
SHARES / MANILA (NOT REQUIRED FOR ENVAGENT-PLUS)
https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/shares/cli_management.html

Chameleon supports creating and managing shared NFS storage volumes (“shares”)
backed by CephFS. These allow users to provision persistent storage that can be
mounted to bare-metal instances using NFS. CLI operations include creating and
deleting shares, resizing them, viewing details, and modifying visibility
(public/private). Working with shares also involves reserving special storage
networks and configuring isolated VLAN environments.

EnvAgent-plus does not mount shared storage, manage NFS volumes, or interact
with project-level CephFS shares. The agent focuses exclusively on provisioning
resources (discovery, reservations, networks, images, and instance launches),
and does not require persistent shared filesystems. Therefore, share management
is out of scope for EnvAgent-plus and excluded from this document.


Additional Chameleon capabilities currently out of scope
-------------------------------------------------------
- FPGA nodes:
    Can be reserved and launched via the same Blazar + Nova APIs
    using different node_type filters, but EnvAgent-plus does not
    treat FPGA nodes specially in v1.

- Trovi sharing portal:
    Web-based artifact sharing and reproducibility portal.
    Not required for creating leases or launching instances.

- Daypass / allocations:
    Allocation and quota management are handled outside EnvAgent-plus.
    We assume the user already has a valid project and allocation.

- KVM virtual machines:
    EnvAgent-plus v1 focuses on bare-metal (physical:host) launches.
    Support for KVM VMs would require additional CLI surface
    (security groups, volumes, etc.) and is intentionally excluded.
