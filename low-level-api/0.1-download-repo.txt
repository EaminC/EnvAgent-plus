1.1 DOWNLOAD AND PREPARE REPO
========================================================

Purpose:
- Make sure the EnvAgent-plus repository and Python environment are ready.

When to use:
- Before any low-level Chameleon operation (reservations, launches, images, networks).
- Again if later steps fail with missing commands, missing repo, or missing Python packages.

Key outputs the LLM should rely on:
- A local folder EnvAgent-plus/ with the expected structure below.
- A working Python environment with required packages installed.
- An OpenStack RC file sourced so OS_* variables are set.

The LLM must not continue to later parts until these conditions are met.


========================================================
1. Clone the repository (first-time setup)
========================================================

If the repo does not exist locally:

    git clone https://github.com/EaminC/EnvAgent-plus.git

Then enter the repo:

    cd EnvAgent-plus


========================================================
2. Update repository (if already installed)
========================================================

If the repo already exists, pull the latest version:

    cd EnvAgent-plus
    git pull origin main


========================================================
3. Expected directory structure
========================================================

The LLM expects the following structure to exist:

    EnvAgent-plus/
        envboot/                 (internal utilities)
        low-level-api/           (reservation, images, networks, keys, etc)
            0-high-level-overview.txt
            1.1-download-repo.txt
            1.2-resource-discovery.txt
            1.3-reservations.txt
            2.1-keys.txt
            2.2-images.txt
            2.3-networks.txt
            2.4-bare-metal-instances.txt
            3.1-floating-ip.txt
            4.1-checks.txt
            excluded-chameleon-capabilities.txt
        src/
        README.md
        requirements.txt
        .venv/   (optional virtual environment)


========================================================
4. Python environment setup
========================================================

If using a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


========================================================
5. Confirm repo readiness (LLM should verify)
========================================================

The LLM must verify the following before running any Chameleon
operations:

    ✔ Repo folder EnvAgent-plus/ exists
    ✔ All *.txt low-level API files are present under low-level-api/
    ✔ User is inside the EnvAgent-plus/ repo directory
    ✔ Python environment is active (if used)
    ✔ Required packages are installed without errors
    ✔ User has sourced an OpenStack RC file (OS_* variables present)

If anything is missing, the LLM must instruct the user how to fix it
before continuing.


========================================================
6. Final reminder for the LLM
========================================================

Do NOT proceed to reservations, images, or networking until:

    - The repository is cloned
    - The repository is up to date
    - Requirements are installed
    - The user has sourced their Chameleon OpenRC file

Once confirmed, the LLM may move on to the next step in the workflow.
